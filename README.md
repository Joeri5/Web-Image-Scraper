# Web Image Scraper

This repository contains a Python script for scraping and downloading images from a website using Selenium in Google Colab. The script includes features like scrolling to the bottom of the webpage, waiting for content to load, and creating a zip file of the downloaded images. The script can be easily customized to scrape images from other websites by modifying the input URL.

## Installation

To use this script, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

- Selenium
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 requests

## Usage

To use the script, simply import it into your Python code and pass in the URL of the website you want to scrape. The script will then download all of the images from the website and save them to a folder in your current working directory. Here is an example usage:

python
Copy code
from web_image_scraper import download_images

```
url = "https://www.example.com"
download_images(url)
```

The script also includes options to customize the scrolling speed, wait time, and other parameters. You can find more information about these options in the documentation.
